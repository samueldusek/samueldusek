Hi, I am Samuel. 👋
</h3>

<h2 align="center">
I am self-taught junior front-end developer with main focus on React & TypeScript.
</h2>

My goal is to become full stack web developer and I am using this GitHub profile to document my journey I am taking to reach this goal. All the repositories you can find here are projects I was working on to improve my web dev skills.

Currently I work as front-end developer at [reservio.com](https://www.reservio.com/). 👨🏽‍💻

## History of my projects ⏳

<h3 align="center">
The discgolf hole of the year 🥏
</h3>

- [Repository](https://github.com/samueldusek/hole-of-the-year)
- Available on [www.jamkaroku.cz](https://www.jamkaroku.cz/)
- This has been my biggest project so far. It was competition that run from 1st of November until 26th of November 2021. The goal of this competition was to choose the most beutiful discgolf hole currently located in the Czech Republic. Almost 2000 people took a place and together they chose hole #4 on DiscGolfPark Kobylí as the most beautiful discgolf hole in the Czech republic. I built it using the NodeJS (Express) and MongoDB (Mongoose). It was a project I built for [prodDiscgolf.cz](https://www.prodiscgolf.cz/) discgolf eshop and here is what the owner had to say about my work (only in 🇨🇿 ):

> Samuelova práce mluví sama za sebe. Jamkaroku.cz byl nejspíš jeden z jeho prvních projektů, všechno ale klapalo jako švýcarské hodinky. Hlavně ale musím ocenit to, že nejenom programoval podle toho, co jsme si vymysleli, ale přidával také svůj vlastní pohled na věc a zkušenosti, díky kterým je web uživatelsky přívětivější a přehlednější. A když už se vyskytl nějaký problém, zareagoval na něj velmi rychle a napravil jej během pár minut.

## My repositories :open_file_folder:

You will find 3 kinds of repositories on my GitHub page.

1. In repositories like [The discgolf hole of the year](https://github.com/samueldusek/hole-of-the-year) you will find code I wrote myself completely from scratch. They are marked with :computer:.

2. In repositories like [The colors generator](https://github.com/samueldusek/colors-generator-react-app) you will find code I wrote following some lecture or tutorial during my studies. They are marked with :mortar_board: and usually they are exact copy of the tutorial or lecture.

3. In repositories like [Todo list app](https://github.com/samueldusek/simple-todo-list-app) you will find code that is based on the code I wrote following some lecture or tutorial but I extended it a lot myself with more features or styles. They are marked with :bulb:.
