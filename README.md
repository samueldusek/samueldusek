## My repositories :open_file_folder:

You will find 3 kinds of repositories on my GitHub page.

1. In repositories like [The discgolf hole of the year](https://github.com/samueldusek/hole-of-the-year) you will find code I wrote myself completely from scratch. They are marked with :computer:.

2. In repositories like [The colors generator](https://github.com/samueldusek/colors-generator-react-app) you will find code I wrote following some lecture or tutorial during my studies. They are marked with :mortar_board: and usually they are exact copy of the tutorial or lecture.

3. In repositories like [Todo list app](https://github.com/samueldusek/simple-todo-list-app) you will find code that is based on the code I wrote following some lecture or tutorial but I extended it a lot myself with more features or styles. They are marked with :bulb:.
